# Leetcode Problems in Java

## All problems can be found here: https://leetcode.com/problemset/

### What this repo is:

This is a repo of common Leetcode questions, I created it as I prefer writing code in an IDE, rather than something like
Leetcode's online platform. A lot of these solutions may not be the most optimal, so don't take them as model answers.
There are also unit tests around every problem, as I wanted to practice my TDD, which I think is something that is often
overlooked especially for these types of interview questions.

I've included 'Solution' classes in each problem package where you can write your own solutions if you wish to do so (I
assume if comes across this, it's  what you'd want to use this repo for). If you want to go a step further though, I'd
recommend setting up something similar to this, so you can also TDD every problem.

I know most if most people had a choice they wouldn't want to solve these kind of questions in a language like Java,
and would prefer something like Python or JavaScript which is understandable, but again this was mainly done to practice
TDD.
